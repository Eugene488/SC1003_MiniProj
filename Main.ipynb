    "\n",

    "Then, the students in each bucket are assigned to groups in a round-robin fashion. If we were to distribute students sequentially within each bucket (i.e., the first student always goes to Group 1, the second to Group 2, and so on), the first group would consistently receive the top students from each bucket. This may result in an unfair imbalance wherein the first group has a noticeably higher average CGPA than, say, the last. To avoid this, we can implement a cyclic distribution on top of the round robin in which the starting index for group assignment shifts each time a new bucket is processed, which ensures that no group consistently receives students from the same position within each bucket.\n",
